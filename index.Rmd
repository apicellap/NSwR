# About {-}

This resource encompasses my compiled notes on Dr. Andy Hector's text, *The New Statistics with R: An Introduction for Biologists* Second edition. Throughout the book he emphasizes the use of Rmarkdown for reproducible research. I take this recommendation a step further by taking all R-related notes in Rmarkdown documents. Nearly every section header corresponds to Dr. Hector's chapter headings. These notes are not meant to replace the textbook. Instead they may act as a helpful guide written by someone who is a student of biostatistics.
