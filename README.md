Welcome!

Getting Started with R: An Introduction for Biologists is a wonderful text that helped me develop R skills. I have taken my notes on this text through several Rmarkdown (.Rmd) documents and compiled them using bookdown. The complete package of these notes can be found at my deployed netlify site: https://zingy-llama-670bfe.netlify.app
